- 👀 I’m interested in ... All things computer networking and security....primarily Cisco, but like to learn as much as I can absorb. Beginning vlogging (youtube, twitch, etc). How to invest for my family's future, and to eventually leave the 9-5 far behind!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Cisco ISE, Cisco Firepower (FMC), Cisco Secure Firewall (known the PIX and ASA since the beginning), Cisco Nexus/DC, Azure infrastructure, Python for automation
